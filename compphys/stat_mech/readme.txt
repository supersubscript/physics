PIsingModel is a simple implementation of a 2-dimensional Ising spin model of magnets. 

This is implemented in Java, which means, it should run under any operating system without recompilation as long as a Java virtual machine is installed. However, you are welcome to change and recompile the source code attached. This is free software. 

Many operating systems can start the program by clicking the .jar file. If you are using Linux, you may also try to click the .sh script, Windows users can try the .bat file.
If that should not work, you usually should first make sure Java is installed. If not, obtain it from e.g. http://www.java.com/download or any other suitable source. 
If Java is installed but the program does not start, most of the time the file ending .jar is not conected to Java (many decompression programs such as 7zip tend to asign this type to themselves). In this case, open a console (Windows: click start, type "cmd" enter or search "cmd", Linux: e.g. "Run command" "console" etc) and navigate to the  folder PIsingModel is in (use the command "cd" to change directory). Then type "java -jar PIsingModel.jar".
